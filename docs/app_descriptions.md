Assistant: Now, create privacy policy. Standard privacy policy for a financial app. Create docs/privacy_policy.md

I need to write a comprehensive privacy policy. Since it's a financial app, it must cover data collection, storage, sharing, etc. Assume it uses Supabase for backend, as there's supabase/ folder. Also, uses OCR (tesseract.js), so camera permissions. Currency data, etc. No ads mentioned, so no ad data. 

Key points:
- Data collected: personal financial data, device info
- How used: to provide services
- Sharing: none, unless required by law
- Security: encryption
- User rights: access, delete data
- Contact info: placeholder

Create the file.
